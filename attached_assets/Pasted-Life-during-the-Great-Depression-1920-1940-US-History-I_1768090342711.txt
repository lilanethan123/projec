Life during the Great Depression (1920-1940)					US History

Introduction: After WWI soldiers came back with injuries and brought a disease which became a pandemic killing more people than the war. The roaring 20’s was a prosperous and happy time for many Americans; they would buy new innovations by putting it on their credit to pay later. Then something happened on October 29, 1929…. Black Tuesday, the stock market crashed. Life became completely depressing in a matter of hours. Many Americans lost their jobs, their homes, all of their money, and were reduced to standing in lines for bread and soup. The Dust Bowl pushes people to leave the central US and food production is scarce. 
Task: Students will be divided up into groups in order to see how people survived 1920-1940 with the Great Depression in the United States. The groups include: WWI impact (injuries & pandemic), Roaring 20’s, Prohibition, Great Depression, Germany & Hitler fascism, Japan’s imperialism & China, Women’s suffrage & minority rights (the Great Migration), Dust Bowl (farmers). Once you are assigned your group, you are to research the topic from the 1920’s through the 1940’s (into WWII).
Process: 
Step 1 – Groups: Students will be split up into 8 groups that represent: WWI impact (injuries & pandemic), Roaring 20’s, Prohibition, Great Depression, Germany & Hitler fascism, Japan’s imperialism & China, Women’s suffrage & minority rights, Dust Bowl (farmers)
Step 2 – Research: Think Story, 5W’s, Showcase topics. Once assigned groups, students will acquire information about the first 1-5 topics including the Great Depression that pertains to their group in particular. 
For instance: What happened? What caused it? What was it like? What did the community do to help the situation? What were the main topics? How did it end? and any other questions that you can think of.
Step 3 – Create: Take the information your group found and split it up into topics: Create a poster or slides depicting your group’s topic in the 1920’s-1940’s.
Step 4 – Add: Each group will add a 1 paragraph Primary story about a person that experienced that topic. Include visuals.
Step 5 – Share: Once all questions are answered and poster/slides are completed, each group will share the information they found with the rest of the class in a 5-7 minute presentation. 
Step 6 – Talk: During each presentation, you will write 2 things you learned and 1 question you have to ask the group.
